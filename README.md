# Machine Learning
Programming projects for a machine learning course at Colorado Technical University (CS379). Each project focused on a question that could be answered with different machine learning algorithms. I did 5 projects over the 5 week class. 
## Project 1: Predicting survivors of the Titanic
The first assignment uses a supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithm to predict survivors when the Titanic sunk based on passenger characteristics. The two algorithms compared are K Means Clustering (unsupervised) and linear regression (supervised). 
## Project 2: Determine factors that influence sleep
In the second assignment, wearable device data was used to predict factors that positively and negatively correlate with deep sleep. A supervised machine learning algorithm, linear regression, is implemented to find the line of best fit between the feature variables and deep sleep.
## Project 3: Credit Risk
The third project implements a machine learning algorithm to predict if a given person applying for a loan will payback or default on the loan.The algorithm is a support vector machine (SVM), a supervised machine learning model. 
## Project 4: 
## Project 5
