# Machine Learning
Programming projects for a machine learning course at Colorado Technical University (CS379). Each project focused on a question that could be answered with different machine learning algorithms. I did 5 projects over the 5 week class. 
## Project 1: Predicting survivors of the Titanic
The first assignment uses a supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithm to predict survivors when the Titanic sunk based on passenger characteristics. The two algorithms compared are K Means Clustering (unsupervised) and linear regression (supervised). 
## Project 2: Determine factors that influence sleep
The second assignment 
## Project 3
## Project 4
## Project 5
