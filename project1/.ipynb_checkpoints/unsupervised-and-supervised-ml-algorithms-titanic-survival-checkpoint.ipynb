    "the purpose of this jupyter notebook is to compare an unsupervised machine learning algorithm with a supervised one. Both models use the titanic data set to make predictions on the survival of passengers based on their characteristics, such as class, sex, ticket price, cabin number, age, etc. I used K Means clustering as an unsupervised model to group passengers into two clusters (survived and not survived). The supervised model is a linear regression. "

    "The above information is all the columns in the titanic dataset. The 'survival' column is the target feature, the thing we are trying to predict. The rest of the columns are feature columns, or information that can help a machine learning model predict if a person survives or not. Instinctively, a passenger's class, sex, age, fare amount, and ability to get on a lifeboat would have an impact on their survival. Columns such as name, ticket number, port of embarkation, and home or destination would not influence their survival, unless there are relationships to other columns, such as lots of first class passengers embarking from the same port. Later in this project, we will look at the variable type of each column and process the columns for use in our machine learning algorithms."

    "It is important to process the data for null values to ready it for machine learning. The above code line, from Gao Hongnan (2021) in Kaggle determines the number of null values in each column. We can see the columns age, cabin, embarked, boat, body and home.dest have missing values. Body refers to body identification number, which presumably is only for passengers who did not survive and whose body was found. It doesn't hold much predictive value for survival, so it is a column we can drop. Furthermore, passenger name may contain some information helpful for predicting survival, such as \"Mr.\" and \"Mrs.\", but we can get that information from the sex column and pclass column. Extracting information from name will be challenging, so we will also drop this column. To process the null values, we will fill them with 0. There are more sofisticated ways to handle null values, such as filling them with the mean value, but this is a simpler way for the scope of this project."

We could look at the distribution of different features, such as the ages of passengers, classes, ticket price, and cabin number using histograms. We could also compare these features with the survival rate, such as the survival rate based on age, class, ticket price, sex, etc. and use bar plots to show survival rates of these different groups. \n",

From replacing null values with 0, we filled 823 lifeboat values with 0. I'm assuming people who had null lifeboat numbers didn't make it onto a lifeboat.

    "The first algorithm we will use is an unsupervised clustering model. This means that the data is not labeled or told how to group data. It simply looks at values and chooses clusters based on those values. With K Means clustering, the programmer gives the algorithms how many clusters they want as the only parameter. In our case we are predicting if a passenger survived or perished on the titanic, so we want 2 clusters: the survived group and the perished group.The computer then chooses two random data points as the centroids of these clusters, creates subsets in the data for the data points closest to each centroid, and determines the mean of each subset (Python Programming Tutorials, n.d.). The means become the new centroids. The algorithm recursively finds centroids until they stop moving, which represents the center of the data for each cluster. To predict which cluster a new data point will belong to, it determines which centroid that data point will be closest to and classifies it as belonging to that cluster. \n",

    "The following code defines a function to measure the accuracy of the fitted model. The code is from Python Programming Tutorials, K Means with Titanic Dataset. The function compares the predicted group assignment of every data point with the actual group that data point belongs in. In the unsupervised model, the groups are randomly assigned as group 0 and group 1. In our data, the survived group is classified as 1 and the perished group is classified as 0. Therefore, the model may sometimes be the inverse of how the data is classified (70% accurate is the same as 30% accurate, because if you keep running the same code it will eventually switch the group names and be the opposite).

    "Now we need to train the model on our dataset. We could train it one one subset and test it on the rest, but that can lead to overfitting the data to the training set. Also, variability in the training/testing data could make a model look like it is performing really well, but then perform worse on new data. A way to get a better sense of how accurate your model is, is to train it multiple times on multiple sets of your data. Say you divide your data into 4 subsets. You can use 3 subsets to train the data and 1 subset to test it, then rotate which subsets are the training and testing sets 4 times. Each iteration will give you the accuracy for that arrangement. The average accuracy, and the variation between each arrangement, gives you an overall idea of how well this type of model will predict this type of data. \n",

    "We can then calculate two important metrics on model accuracy: mean squared error and the coefficient of determination (r2). Mean squared error is the average distance every data point lies from the line of best fit (Arcitura Education, 2021). The mean squared error here is the average across every model of those averages for each model. We want this number to be close to 0, which represents data points lying very close to the line of best fit. The coefficient of determination is a measure of how correlated the target variable is to the predictive variables (Arcitura Education, 2021). In this scenario, it is the percent of the variation in 'survival' that can be explained by variation in the feature variables. The closer to 1 (100%), the more variation in survival is explained by the feature variables. "

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "This project used the Titanic dataset to predict the survival of passengers. Two types of machine learning algorithms were used: unsupervised and supervised. The unsupervised model is k means clustering and the supervised model is linear regression. The unsupervised clustering model accurately predicted passenger survival 73% of the time. The supervised model line of best fit is, on average, within 0.08 of the data points. Exploratory analysis with correlation matrices and bar plots was helpful in learning about the dataset. Data processing was super important to handle missing values, handle non-numeric data, and drop irrelevant data. "
