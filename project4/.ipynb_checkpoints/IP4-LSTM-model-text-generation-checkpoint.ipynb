    "## Project Description\n",
    "This project trains a long short-term memory (LSTM) model on the Alice In Wonderland book to generate text. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network that can remember past predictions to help generate new ones (Rohrer, 2017). This is really useful for teaching computers to read and write, because the model remembers patterns in syntax and word frequency. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project is on a local computer, which made training and fitting the model take a long time with a single CPU processor. A way to scale this project to accept more data, find more features, and be trained faster is with distributed computing on GPU processors. The way LSTM works is performing the same computation on every piece of data across an entire layer, then sending the results to the next layer. That layer performs a different computation on every piece of data and sends the results to the next layer, etc. GPU's are designed to perform simple, repetitive computations in parallel, so they could quickly process the inputs and generate outputs for a single layer in parallel. Within each layer, the neurons are independent, so a single layer could be distributed between many GPU's for even more parallel computing. Communication/consolidation is needed between the different GPU's when they send their outputs to the next layer of the model so that the neurons in the next layer are seeing the output from the neuron's in the previous layer that connect to them. A final consolidation function would take the results from each GPU and produce the final output.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I tested out 2 models. One model has 3 layers: an LSTM layer, a pruning layer, and an output layer. It was trained on the entire dataset 2 times to begin improving the weights of each neuron at each layer with backpropogation. It's loss value is 2.71 and it can produce text that has some semblance to english words. The second model has 5 layers: 2 LSTM layers, 2 pruning layers, and an output layer. It was trained on the entire dataset 10 times to better improve the model's weights with backpropogation. Epoch 5 showed the lowest loss value (1.99), so the weights calculated in epoch 5 were used when the model generated text. The output used more real words and repeated a longer pattern than the first model, showing it is getting better at \"reading\" and \"writing\".  \n",

      "time, but never one with such a neck as that!  no, no!  you're a\n",
      "serpent; and there's no use denying it.  i suppose you'll be\n",

      "\n",
      "  `i have tasted eggs, certainly,' said alice, who was a very\n",

      "serpent?'\n",

      "trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled\n",
      "among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and\n",
      "untwist it.  after a while she remembered that she still held the\n",
      "pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very\n",
      "carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and\n",

      "the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work\n",

      "writing-desks, which wasn't much.\n",
      "\n",
      "  the hatter was the first to break the silence.  `what day of\n",

      "it every now and then, and holding it to his ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "  alice considered a little, and then said `the fourth.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `two days wrong!' sighed the hatter.  `i told you butter\n",

      "\n",

      "  the march hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily:  then\n",
      "he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again:  but he\n",

      "was the best butter, you know.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity.\n",

      "\n",

      "you what year it is?'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `of course not,' alice replied very readily:  `but that's\n",

      "have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly english.\n",
      "`i don't quite understand you,' she said, as politely as she\n",
      "could.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `the dormouse is asleep again,' said the hatter, and he poured\n",
      "a little hot tea upon its nose.\n",
      "\n",
      "  the dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without\n",

      "  `no, i give it up,' alice replied:  `what's the answer?'\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "  `ah! that accounts for it,' said the hatter.  `he won't stand\n",
      "beating.  now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do\n",
      "almost anything you liked with the clock.  for instance, suppose\n",
      "it were nine o'clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons:\n",

      "two, and the game began.  alice thought she had never seen such a\n",
      "curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and\n",

      "but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened\n",
      "out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it\n",

      "puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing:\n",
      "and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again,\n",
      "it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled\n",
      "itself, and was in the act of crawling away:  besides all this,\n",
      "there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she\n",
      "wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers\n",
      "were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the\n",

      "difficult game indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "  the players all played at once without waiting for turns,\n",
      "quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in\n",

      "  she was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering\n",

      "first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to\n",

      "no more of it appeared.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "  `well, it must be removed,' said the king very decidedly, and\n",

      "wish you would have this cat removed!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  the queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great\n",

      "of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and\n",
      "she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in\n",

      "and looked very uncomfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "  the moment alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to\n",
      "settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her,\n",

      "to make out exactly what they said.\n",
      "\n",
